# Skin_Disease-Detection-
Skin diseases can have a significant impact on a person's health and well-being. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. This project focuses on automating the detection and classification of skin diseases using machine learning.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the 'hmnist.csv' dataset. It contains images of various skin diseases. You can find more information about the dataset in the data folder.

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/aliashaheen1/skin-disease-detection.git
cd skin-disease-detection
Install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Ensure you have downloaded the 'hmnist.csv' dataset and placed it in the 'data' folder.

Run the main script to train and evaluate the model:

#python main.py
Follow the prompts to interact with the model.

Model Architecture
The neural network model used for this project consists of multiple layers, including Dense layers with ReLU activation functions. The model architecture is defined in the main.py script.

Performance
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy as the primary metric. After training, the test accuracy is calculated and displayed. You can find more details in the results folder.
